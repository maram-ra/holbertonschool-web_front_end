# HTML Advanced - Techium Website

This project is part of the **Foundations v2.1 - Part 2** curriculum at Holberton School. It focuses on advanced usage of **HTML5 semantic elements** to structure the layout and content of a professional website called **Techium**, a fictional digital agency.

## Objective

The goal is to learn how to:

- Build the full skeleton of an HTML5 webpage
- Use semantic tags to improve accessibility and SEO
- Create reusable content structures (header, footer, nav, sections, articles)
- Embed various media types (images, video, audio, iframe)
- Create a style guide to document HTML usage
- Prepare content for future styling with CSS

## Project Structure

All files are located in the `html_advanced/` directory. Each task builds incrementally on top of the previous task, from `0-index.html` to `36-index.html`, plus:

- `styleguide.html` – a complete style guide reference
- `about.html`, `contact.html`, `latest_news.html` – additional static pages
- `logo-black.png` and favicons – static assets used in headers and footers
- `images/` – contains section images, avatars, and blog illustrations

## Topics Covered

- HTML5 semantic structure: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`, `section`, `article`, `aside`
- Head elements: `meta`, `title`, `link`, `favicon`
- Lists: `ul`, `ol`, `dl`
- Media: `img`, `video`, `audio`, `iframe`
- Headings: `h1` to `h6` hierarchy
- Typography: `blockquote`, `q`, `address`, `pre`, `code`, `mark`
- Accessibility & best practices
- Proper use of comments and grouping content with `div`

## Requirements

- All pages must pass **W3C HTML validation** (unless stated otherwise)
- Filenames must follow the naming pattern (e.g., `0-index.html`, `13-styleguide.html`, etc.)
- All assets must be placed in correct directories and referenced properly
- Semantic HTML is required – no inline styles or CSS used
